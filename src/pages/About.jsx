          During the first few years of the new millennium, it was observed that
          a lot of companies who came to college campuses to recruit fresh
          graduates started to lay special emphasis on communication skills,
          confidence, spontaneous thinking, working under pressure and other
          such soft skills. A lack of these skills among the students affected
          their recruitment prospects although they possessed sound technical
          knowledge and ability. This was the case not only in our college but
          all over Gujarat. With a common vision to overcome this flaw among
          students, Paramarsh was started in the year 2001 by a group of
          students from the Faculty of Technology & Engineering, M.S.U.,
          Vadodara as an intra-college event. What began as a humble event
          consisting of only Group Discussion has now evolved and become the
          biggest non-technical fiesta of the entire West Zone. The word
          ‘Paramarsh’ has its roots in the Sanskrit, meaning ‘Supreme thought’.
          An event organized by the budding engineers of M.S. University,
          Paramarsh is a non-profit organization with a sole aim of instilling
          in students the 7 commandments for corporate excellence- ‘Leadership’,
          ‘Team spirit’, ‘Sportsmanship’, ‘Creativity’, ‘the spirit of
          adventure’, ‘the art of Oration’ and ‘Science of Deduction’. Apart
          from 15 different events in the aforementioned categories,
          wide-arrayed workshops and interplays, enlightening social
          initiatives, inspiring guest-lectures, stunning band performances and
          spell-binding concerts; all form an integral part of Paramarsh and
          helps this 3-day festival live upto its tag-line: Ideas Infinite!
